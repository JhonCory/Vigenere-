# Vigenere-
This Scala program uses a XOR-ing variant of the Vigen√©re Cipher to encrypt and decrypt plaintext and ciphertext, respectively. It also supports decoding ciphertext given a well-selected crib word.

To demonstrate the encrypt/decrypt feature, use the commands "scala Cipher -decrypt insecure transmission1.txt" and/or "scala Cipher -decrypt insecure transmission1=2.txt" while in the build directory.

To demonstrate the software's feature of decoding with the use of a crib word, use "scala Cipher -crib burritos transmission3.txt" while in the build directory.

This software was written by E.J. Khouri in 2014.
